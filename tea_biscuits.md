# Tea biscuit

A tea biscuit dough should be soft but not sticky. A little kneading improves the quality of the biscuits, but should be done with gentle touch as too much handling tends to make them tough.

**Instructions**
1. Preheat oven to 450F
2. Blend of sift together
    - `2 cups of pre-sifted PURITY all-purpose flour`
    - `4 teaspoons baking powder`
    - `1/4 teaspoon salt`
3. Cut in finely
    - `1/3 cup shortening` OR `1/3 cup and 1 tablespoon of butter`
4. Add
    - `3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk`
    - `3/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons of 1 egg and milk mixture - put egg in glass measuring cup and add milk until desired volume is reached`
    - `Stir with a fork to make a soft dough`
5. Turn dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead gently 8 to 10 times. Roll or pat to desired thickness (biscuits will be doubled in height when baked). Cut out with a floured cutter.
6. Place biscuits on a ungreased baking sheet, close together for a soft-sided biscuits or about 1" apart for a crusty-sided biscuits.
7. Bake in preheated 450F oven for 12 to 15 minutes.
